# PlusBuddy

This project was a requirement to complete my fourth year in BSc with Honours in Information Technology.

It was an individual full stack development for a cross-platform real time mobile application containing information to educate people about HIV and to build a people network.

Users can create profiles, access other users' profiles, send buddy requests and chat.

Full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was strictly followed.

React Native and Firestore were used.
