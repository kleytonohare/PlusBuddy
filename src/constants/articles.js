        body: `Avert.org says “HIV crossed from chimps to humans in the 1920s in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. This was probably as a result of chimps carrying the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a virus closely related to HIV”. And History.com adds SIV “jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps\' infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters”. 
        A lot of people think HIV/ AIDS started in 1980s and that is because it came to public attention when first cases appeared in Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco, in the United States of America.`
